      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Computer Science graduate with a passion for crafting responsive, user-friendly web applications. I specialize in frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks such as React.js and Next.js.

On the backend, I work with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB to build robust and scalable server-side applications. I'm also well-versed in tools like Git & GitHub for version control, Postman for API testing, and Figma for UI/UX design planning.

I enjoy turning ideas into fully functional, clean, and interactive digital experiences. My goal is to continuously learn, improve, and contribute to building impactful web solutions.
